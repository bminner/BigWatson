So there is no way for me to plug it in here in the US unless I go by a converter.,negative
Tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutes.MAJOR PROBLEMS!!,negative
I have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume.,negative
If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one.,negative
Needless to say I wasted my money.,negative
What a waste of money and time!.,negative
If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.,negative
The design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all.,negative
I advise EVERYONE DO NOT BE FOOLED!,negative
It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.,negative
I went on Motorola's website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again.,negative
The commercials are the most misleading.,negative
I bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery.,negative
I didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me.,negative
People couldnt hear me talk and I had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone.,negative
Doesn't hold charge.,negative
This is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible.,negative
It is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed.,negative
I have two more years left in this contract and I hate this phone.,negative
You need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phone.Battery life is short.,negative
Poor Talk Time Performance.,negative
worthless product.,negative
I was not impressed by this product.,negative
I only hear garbage for audio.,negative
Who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery?.,negative
AFTER ARGUING WITH VERIZON REGARDING THE DROPPED CALLS WE RETURNED THE PHONES AFTER TWO DAYS.,negative
Disappointed with battery.,negative
Not loud enough and doesn't turn on like it should.,negative
VERY DISAPPOINTED.,negative
The buttons for on and off are bad.,negative
Essentially you can forget Microsoft's tech support.,negative
Buy a different phone - but not this.,negative
You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly.,negative
The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.,negative
A week later after I activated it it suddenly died.,negative
Mic Doesn't work.,negative
Even in my BMW 3 series which is fairly quiet I have trouble hearing what the other person is saying.,negative
Do Not Buy for D807...wrongly advertised for D807.,negative
I purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working!!!!!!!!!,negative
Not a good bargain.,negative
The battery runs down quickly.,negative
This item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use.,negative
The construction of the headsets is poor.,negative
For a product that costs as much as this one does I expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does.,negative
The ear buds only play music in one ear.,negative
Dont waste your money...,negative
If you plan to use this in a car forget about it.,negative
I found this product to be waaay too big.,negative
I'm very disappointed with my decision.,negative
Buyer Beware you could flush money right down the toilet.,negative
I received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger.,negative
That's a huge design flaw (unless I'm not using it correctly which I don't think is the case).,negative
The camera although rated at an impressive 1.3 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution.,negative
I purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work.,negative
i got this phone around the end of may and i'm completely unhappy with it.,negative
Could not get strong enough signal.,negative
Bad Quality.,negative
Basically the service was very bad.,negative
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger!.,negative
The BT headset was such a disapoinment.,negative
Buyer--Be Very Careful!!!!!.,negative
The majority of the Logitech earbud headsets failed.,negative
In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement.,negative
What a waste.,negative
During several different 2 minute calls I experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars.,negative
I was not happy with this item.,negative
very disappointed.,negative
The phone takes FOREVER to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally.,negative
What a waste of time!,negative
Its reception is very very poor.,negative
Items stated as included from the description ARE NOT INCLUDED.,negative
After 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden.,negative
I Was Hoping for More.,negative
Audio Quality is poor very poor.,negative
I've bought $5 wired headphones that sound better than these.,negative
All I can do is whine on the Internet so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it.,negative
This is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate.,negative
I still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones we just obviously don't share enough DNA to copy the design over to humans.,negative
Doesn't work at all.. I bougth it for my L7c and its not working.,negative
doesn't last long.,negative
One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side.,negative
Thank you for wasting my money.,negative
How can that be?The audio quality is poor.,negative
I put the latest OS on it (v1.15g) and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while.,negative
It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device.,negative
If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you!,negative
Don't buy this product.,negative
I've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear.,negative
I have this phone and it is a thorn in my side I really abhor it.,negative
I recently had problems where I could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected.,negative
Design Flaw?.,negative
Waste of 13 bucks.,negative
But when I check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then I'm lost.,negative
The replacement died in a few weeks.,negative
I have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more.,negative
Not impressed.,negative
Bad Choice.,negative
The pleather case doesn't fit.,negative
useless phone simply deaf.,negative
It makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call.,negative
Battery lasts only a few hours.,negative
We are sending it back.,negative
I did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but I learned the lesson that I should not have bought this form online anyway.,negative
If you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means.,negative
I also didn't like the on button it felt like it would crack with use.,negative
WORST PHONE EVER.,negative
Freezes frequently4.,negative
It's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is.,negative
All in all I'd expected a better consumer experience from Motorola.,negative
There's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before.,negative
I'm a bit disappointed.,negative
I have had this phone for over a year now and I will tell you its not that great.,negative
I ordered this for sony Ericsson W810i but I think it only worked once (thats when I first used it).,negative
The battery is completely useless to me.,negative
What a big waste of time.,negative
Don't waste your $$$ on this one.,negative
Do not make the same mistake as me.,negative
Big Disappointment with calendar sync.,negative
the phone was unusable and was not new.,negative
Worst Customer Service Ever.,negative
No additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever.,negative
It defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset.,negative
Internet is excrutiatingly slow.,negative
This product had a strong rubber/petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it,negative
poor quality and service.,negative
The cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary.,negative
Absolutel junk.,negative
THAT one didn't work either.,negative
Returned 8 hours later.,negative
Don't waste your money!.,negative
Not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it.,negative
Unreliable - I'm giving up.,negative
Avoid this one if you can.,negative
I wasted my little money with this earpiece.,negative
First of all it doesn't wear well.,negative
I wouldn't recommend buying this product.,negative
Piece of Junk.,negative
Poorly contstruct hinge.,negative
Don't buy it.,negative
DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE.,negative
Customer service was terrible.,negative
Battery life still not long enough in Motorola Razor V3i.,negative
Sending it back.,negative
As many people complained I found this headset's microphone was very weak.,negative
My 5-year old Nokia 2160 from Tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this.,negative
They do not care about the consumer one bit.,negative
The instruction manual is lacking.,negative
The battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena.,negative
It's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone (Razr) or with my previous wired headset (that plugged into an LG).,negative
I want my money back.,negative
I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately.,negative
The Ngage is still lacking in earbuds.,negative
I have 2-3 bars on my cell phone when I am home but you cant not hear anything.,negative
However-the riingtones are not the best and neither are the games.,negative
The plug did not work very well.,negative
AMAZON SUCKS.,negative
Rip off---- Over charge shipping.,negative
1. long lasting battery (you don't have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones)2.,negative
Obviously there is a problem with the adhesive.,negative
Very disappointing.,negative
It was an inexpensive piece but I would still have expected better quality.,negative
It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.,negative
Was not happy.,negative
A PIECE OF JUNK THAT BROKE AFTER BEING ON MY PHONE FOR 2 DAYS!!!,negative
Worst customer service.,negative
Reception is terrible and full of static.,negative
I was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal.,negative
Were JERKS on the phone.,negative
Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible.,negative
Excellent starter wireless headset.,negative
The loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing.,negative
The only thing that I think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset.,negative
First off the reception sucks I have never had more than 2 bars ever.,negative
The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT!,negative
Also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down.,negative
bad fit way too big.,negative
Waste of money.,negative
I'll be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason.,negative
The worst phone I've ever had.... Only had it for a few months.,negative
Not a good item.. It worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player.,negative
This is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear.,negative
This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network.,negative
Soyo technology sucks.,negative
Same problem as others have mentioned.,negative
The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service.,negative
Poor sound quality.,negative
The picture resolution is far below what other comparably-priced phones are offering today.,negative
Using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear.,negative
Still Waiting...... I'm sure this item would work well.. if I ever recieve it!,negative
what a disappointment,negative
don't waste your money and time.,negative
It's so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out.,negative
I came over from Verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones.... the first thing I noticed was the really bad service.,negative
I'll be looking for a new earpiece.,negative
We received a WHITE colored battery that goes DEAD after a couple hoursTHe original used to last a week - but still lasts longer than thereplacement,negative
After a year the battery went completely dead on my headset.,negative
This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made.,negative
Att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk.,negative
The plastic breaks really easy on this clip.,negative
Don't make the same mistake I did.,negative
Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone.,negative
Also the area where my unit broke).- I'm not too fond of the magnetic strap.,negative
Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model.,negative
Low Quality.,negative
Warning - Stay away.,negative
I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.,negative
I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.,negative
If you don't find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone.,negative
Very Displeased.,negative
I might have gotten a defect but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone.,negative
They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.,negative
Does not fit.,negative
There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset.,negative
I even fully charged it before I went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wi-fi and noticed that it only had 20 % left in the morning.,negative
I've also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again.,negative
Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.,negative
Horrible phone.,negative
BT50 battery junk!.,negative
Cant get the software to work with my computer.,negative
Disappointed!.,negative
poor voice clarity.,negative
No buyers remorse on this one!.,negative
Very disappointed in AccessoryOne.,negative
I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers.,negative
The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.,negative
Disappointment.. I hate anything that goes in my ear.,negative
Uncomfortable In the Ear Don't use with LG VX9900 (EnV).,negative
The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.,negative
I'd like to return it.,negative
Verizon's bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple.,negative
A Disappointment.,negative
Its not user friendly.,negative
Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.,negative
Then I exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem.,negative
This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.,negative
Pretty piece of junk.,negative
Plug was the wrong size.,negative
Save your money.... I've had this item for 11 months now.,negative
Bad Purchase.,negative
Defective crap.,negative
I would have given no star if I was able.,negative
The sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing.,negative
I would not recommend this item to anyone.,negative
The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.,negative
As an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens.,negative
You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.,negative
I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.,negative
My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5(of 5),negative
REALLY UGLY.,negative
horrible had to switch 3 times.,negative
No real improvement.,negative
They refuse to refund or replace.,negative
Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.,negative
So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.,negative
All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.,negative
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.,negative
I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.,negative
Perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when I use this.,negative
Don't buy this product.,negative
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone.,negative
Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.,negative
Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.,negative
The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.,negative
I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T and inform them of this practice.,negative
It's AGGRAVATING!,negative
None of it works just don't buy it.,negative
Muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off.,negative
Please dont waste your money.,negative
If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking this isn't it.,negative
Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.,negative
Disapointing Results.,negative
Cumbersome design.,negative
It's A PIECE OF CRAP!,negative
My experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!,negative
Worst ever.,negative
I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what?,negative
The battery life is highly unacceptable.,negative
That company is a joke.,negative
Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.,negative
Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set wiping out all my data.,negative
Voice Quality Signal Strength Dropped Calls.,negative
It feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.,negative
Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.,negative
I only used it two days and it wasn't always easy to hear with.,negative
I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.,negative
Sprint - terrible customer service.,negative
What possesed me to get this junk I have no idea...,negative
Piece of trash.,negative
The real killer is the volume and of course it breaking.,negative
Poor Construction.,negative
This is infuriating.,negative
Sprint charges for this service.,negative
It is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap.,negative
It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.,negative
the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.,negative
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.,negative
Poor product.,negative
However I needed some better instructions.,negative
You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.,negative
Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens which come in a three-pack.,negative
DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS,negative
Plus I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.,negative
Very Dissapointing Performance.,negative
Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone.,negative
This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand.,negative
Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.,negative
Don't bother - go to the store.,negative
You get what you pay for I guess.,negative
However BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.,negative
Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.,negative
Performed awful -- muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.,negative
Obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for.,negative
I contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck.,negative
Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!,negative
When I placed my treo into the case not only was it NOT snug but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides.,negative
Battery is terrible.,negative
The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.,negative
Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.,negative
The charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work.,negative
Finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.,negative
Talk about USELESS customer service.,negative
It felt too light and tinny..,negative
This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.,negative
I could not recommend these more.,negative
Looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment!!,negative
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.,negative
A must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design.,negative
The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.,negative
Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.,negative
Can't upload ringtones from a third party.,negative
Bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.,negative
Truly awful.,negative
And none of the tones is acceptable.,negative
camera color balance is AWFUL.,negative
This product is clearly not ready for prime time I don't care how cool it looks if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.,negative
Chinese Forgeries Abound!.,negative
The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.,negative
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.,negative
Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!,negative
The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.,negative
The biggest complaint I have is the battery drains superfast.,negative
The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.,negative
Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.,negative
It doesn't make you look cool.,negative
Also the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.,negative
So just beware.,negative
So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.,negative
I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.,negative
Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.,negative
It lasts less than 3o minutes if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.,negative
Poor quality.,negative
Not worth it.,negative
The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.,negative
Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac external battery wall outlet etc).,negative
if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.,negative
Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!,negative
After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.,negative
None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.,negative
We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros,negative
Couldn't use the unit with sunglasses not good in Texas!,negative
It dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320.,negative
Bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing.,negative
If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you!,negative
stay away from this store be careful.,negative
Does not fit.,negative
disappointing.,negative
The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.,negative
Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.,negative
The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.,negative
Would not reccommend.,negative
This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.,negative
wont work right or atleast for me.,negative
in addition it feels &amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.,negative
But now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it.,negative
I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for me.The good,negative
AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.,negative
VERY cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor.,negative
I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones I have not had this problem.,negative
After my phone got to be about a year old it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.,negative
I am sorry I made this purchase.,negative
I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.,negative
Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.,negative
It was horrible!.,negative
I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.,negative
This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.,negative
They work about 2 weeks then break.,negative
I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.,negative
NOT WHAT I WANTED.,negative
The internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked.,negative
$50 Down the drain.,negative
I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great.,negative
If there is a wind it is completely useless.,negative
Does Not Work.,negative
At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44 until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr).,negative
Improper description.... I had to return it.,negative

The calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently.,negative
Horrible horrible protector.,negative
I don't like this Nokia either.,negative
Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3.,negative
I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.,negative
It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.,negative
the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!!,negative
Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.,negative
Product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with.,negative
It's not what it says it is.,negative
Stay Away From the Q!.,negative
Used and dirty.,negative
Very unreliable service from T-mobile !,negative
Not good enough for the price.,negative

This was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts.,negative
Terrible phone holder.,negative
Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.,negative
Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.,negative
How stupid is that?,negative
It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.,negative
Couldn't figure it out,negative
My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK) but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldn't understand a word being said on it.,negative
So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it.,negative
While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop.,negative
Saggy floppy piece of junk.,negative
It also had a new problem.,negative

The worst was the salmon sashimi.,negative
This was like the final blow!,negative
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.,negative
Poor service the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.,negative
Service sucks.,negative
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.,negative
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.,negative
Frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register.,negative
It's too bad the food is so damn generic.,negative
They have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.,negative
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.,negative
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.,negative
The ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless.,negative
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.,negative
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.,negative
The service was meh.,negative
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk.,negative
I guess I should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the Excalibur but I didn't use my common sense.,negative
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.,negative
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !,negative
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.,negative
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.,negative
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.,negative
The turkey and roast beef were bland.,negative
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.,negative
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.,negative
In summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience.,negative
Never been to Hard Rock Casino before WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!,negative
say bye bye to your tip lady!,negative
We'll never go again.,negative
It was not good.,negative
REAL sushi lovers let's be honest - Yama is not that good.,negative
At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasn't that busy.,negative
It was pretty gross!,negative
I've had better atmosphere.,negative
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.,negative
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing.,negative
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.,negative
Worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries.,negative
Host staff were for lack of a better word BITCHES!,negative
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...,negative
I wouldn't return.,negative
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.,negative
The management is rude.,negative
He was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.,negative
Don't do it!!!!,negative
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.,negative
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.,negative
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.,negative
The menu is always changing food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.,negative
The service was a little slow  considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.,negative
I give it 2 thumbs down,negative
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.,negative
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.,negative
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.,negative
Unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.,negative
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.,negative
Avoid at all cost!,negative
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...,negative
I've never been treated so bad.,negative
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.,negative
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but I'm not inspired to go back.,negative
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.,negative
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.,negative
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.,negative
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.,negative
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!,negative
It was probably dirt.,negative
The food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.,negative
When my order arrived one of the gyros was missing.,negative
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.,negative
The live music on Fridays totally blows.,negative
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.,negative
The warm beer didn't help.,negative
I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.,negative
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.,negative
Must have been an off night at this place.,negative
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.,negative
For about 10 minutes we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon.,negative
Won't go back.,negative
Soggy and not good.,negative
Which are small and not worth the price.,negative
The shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!,negative
The service was a bit lacking.,negative
Lobster Bisque Bussell Sprouts Risotto Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.,negative
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.,negative
It was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad.,negative
As for the mains also uninspired.,negative
If the food isn't bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.,negative
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah still sucks.,negative
If it were possible to give them zero stars they'd have it.,negative
The descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayo...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.,negative
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.,negative
Horrible - don't waste your time and money.,negative
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.,negative
(It wasn't busy either) Also the building was FREEZING cold.,negative
like the other reviewer said you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again.,negative
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.,negative
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.,negative
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.,negative
Overall I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.,negative
I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.,negative
very tough and very short on flavor!,negative
I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.,negative
The service was not up to par either.,negative
For a self proclaimed coffee cafe I was wildly disappointed.,negative
I've had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from Jenni Pho.,negative
I think not again,negative
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.,negative
Service stinks here!,negative
I waited and waited.,negative
This place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant.,negative
Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.,negative
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.,negative
I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.,negative
Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!,negative
Just don't know why they were so slow.,negative
I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here because it is a convenient location.,negative
Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.,negative
Never again will I be dining at this place!,negative
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.,negative
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.,negative
Food was really boring.,negative
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!,negative
Will never ever go back.,negative
As much as I'd like to go back I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return.,negative
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.,negative
Never going back.,negative
The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.,negative
By this point my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.,negative
The only downside is the service.,negative
Also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.,negative
I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for $4.00.,negative
When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.,negative
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.,negative
Everything was gross.,negative
First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!,negative
The burger... I got the Gold Standard a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed.,negative
There is nothing authentic about this place.,negative
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.,negative
The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.,negative
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.,negative
He was terrible!,negative
It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.,negative
Sadly Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.,negative
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.,negative
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.,negative
I find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasn't food.,negative
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.,negative
I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.,negative
They dropped more than the ball.,negative
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.,negative
I took back my money and got outta there.,negative
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.,negative
The staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.,negative
I won't be back.,negative
The food was terrible.,negative
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.,negative
I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.,negative
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.,negative
This is a disgrace.,negative
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.,negative
This one is simply a disappointment.,negative
Overall I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.,negative
I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!,negative
Left very frustrated.,negative
TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.,negative
For service I give them no stars.,negative
I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.,negative
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).,negative
But now I was completely grossed out.,negative
On the ground right next to our table was a large smeared been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.,negative
Furthermore you can't even find hours of operation on the website!,negative
We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.,negative
What a mistake that was!,negative
Waiter was a jerk.,negative
Strike 2 who wants to be rushed.,negative
I never come again.,negative
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.,negative
It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.,negative
I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.,negative
Nothing special.,negative
Will not be back.,negative
Sauce was tasteless.,negative
I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.,negative
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.,negative
I was so insulted.,negative
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.,negative
The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.,negative
Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.,negative
The manager was the worst.,negative
I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.,negative
This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.,negative
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.,negative
Don't waste your time here.,negative
Total letdown I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.,negative
Third the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.,negative
We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.,negative
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.,negative
The selection of food was not the best.,negative
I dont think I will be back for a very long time.,negative
It was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign.,negative
Worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.,negative
And then tragedy struck.,negative
I'd rather eat airline food seriously.,negative
I would not recommend this place.,negative
Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.,negative
My gyro was basically lettuce only.,negative
Terrible service!,negative
Thoroughly disappointed!,negative
it was a drive to get there.,negative
Anyway I do not think i will go back there.,negative
A greasy unhealthy meal.,negative
first time there and might just be the last.,negative
Similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.,negative
And it was way to expensive.,negative
Terrible management.,negative
If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.,negative
Worst martini ever!,negative
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).,negative
I won't try going back there even if it's empty.,negative
No I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.,negative
not even a hello we will be right with you.,negative
The desserts were a bit strange.,negative
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.,negative
However my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.,negative
I know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here!,negative
AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!,negative
I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.,negative
My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.,negative
After two I felt disgusting.,negative
I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!,negative
The servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an Are you being helped?,negative
AN HOUR... seriously?,negative
I consider this theft.,negative
Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.,negative
We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.,negative
Waited and waited and waited.,negative
The pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way.,negative
I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.,negative
Boy was that sucker dry!!.,negative
Over rated.,negative
If you look for authentic Thai food go else where.,negative
After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.,negative
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.,negative
The kids play area is NASTY!,negative
It was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless.,negative
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.,negative
I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!,negative
Not good for the money.,negative
We got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived.,negative
I just wanted to leave.,negative
I will not be eating there again.,negative
!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!,negative
I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.,negative
The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy.,negative
Sorry I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(,negative
My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.,negative
Despite how hard I rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.,negative
I will not return.,negative
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.,negative
Very disappointing!!!,negative
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.,negative
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.,negative
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.,negative
I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.,negative
Same evening him and I are both drastically sick.,negative
Ordered burger rare came in we'll done.,negative
Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.,negative
After waiting an hour and being seated I was not in the greatest of moods.,negative
I'm not eating here!,negative
Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.,negative
This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.,negative
Very bad Experience!,negative
What a mistake.,negative
Food was average at best.,negative
We won't be going back anytime soon!,negative
Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.,negative
Not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed.,negative
The fried rice was dry as well.,negative
Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.,negative
dont go here.,negative
As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.,negative
The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.,negative
Service was slow and not attentive.,negative
Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.,negative
Total brunch fail.,negative
I probably won't be back to be honest.,negative
Went for lunch - service was slow.,negative
We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed.,negative
I was mortified.,negative
Needless to say we will never be back here again.,negative
Anyways The food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more.,negative
The chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible.,negative
I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.,negative
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.,negative
Would not recommend to others.,negative
I mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!,negative
Not my thing.,negative
If you are reading this please don't go there.,negative
Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.,negative
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.,negative
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!,negative
The food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.,negative
Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.,negative
Probably never coming back and wouldn't recommend it.,negative
Friend's pasta -- also bad he barely touched it.,negative
It was way over fried.,negative
I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.,negative
When I opened the sandwich I was impressed but not in a good way.,negative
Will not be back!,negative
I have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!,negative
Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up.,negative
I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.,negative
The service was poor and thats being nice.,negative
The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!,negative
The chicken dishes are OK the beef is like shoe leather.,negative
But the service was beyond bad.,negative
Tasted like dirt.,negative
My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.,negative
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional Hunan style.,negative
What did bother me was the slow service.,negative
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.,negative
So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.,negative
My girlfriend's veal was very bad.,negative
Unfortunately it was not good.,negative
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.,negative
The chains which I'm no fan of beat this place easily.,negative
We will not be coming back.,negative
Once your food arrives it's meh.,negative
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.,negative
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too.,negative
Mediocre food.,negative
I'm super pissd.,negative
Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?,negative
I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat.,negative
Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.,negative
The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!,negative
The service was terrible though.,negative
This place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is OVERPRICED!,negative
It was packed!!,negative
The food was terrible.,negative
It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.,negative
This place should honestly be blown up.,negative
But I definitely would not eat here again.,negative
Do not waste your money here!,negative
Awful service.,negative
Won't ever go here again.,negative
Food quality has been horrible.,negative
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.,negative
The service here is fair at best.,negative
I do love sushi but I found Kabuki to be over-priced over-hip and under-services.,negative
Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.,negative
Very poor service.,negative
No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.,negative
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.,negative
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.,negative
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.,negative
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food.,negative
I won't be back.,negative
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!,negative
This place deserves no stars.,negative
I would not recommend this place.,negative
To my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.,negative
Bad day or not I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise!!,negative
I probably would not go here again.,negative
The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp) and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either.,negative
My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.,negative
I probably won't be coming back here.,negative
Worst food/service I've had in a while.,negative
Hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.,negative
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.,negative
I started this review with two stars but I'm editing it to give it only one.,negative
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.,negative
Weird vibe from owners.,negative
There was hardly any meat.,negative
I've had better bagels from the grocery store.,negative
Now the burgers aren't as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.,negative
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.,negative
The service was terrible food was mediocre.,negative
I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.,negative
On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.,negative
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.,negative
The service was extremely slow.,negative
After 20 minutes wait I got a table.,negative
No allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.,negative
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.,negative
Worst Thai ever.,negative
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!,negative
Spend your money elsewhere.,negative
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.,negative
And the drinks are WEAK people!,negative
-My order was not correct.,negative
Also I feel like the chips are bought not made in house.,negative
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.,negative
We won't be returning.,negative
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.,negative
Very very sad.,negative
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that?,negative
How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak I don't understand!,negative
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.,negative
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.,negative
There is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better,negative
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.,negative
They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!,negative
What SHOULD have been a hilarious yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.,negative
Needless to say I won't be going back anytime soon.,negative
This place is disgusting!,negative
The RI style calamari was a joke.,negative
However there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible.,negative
I could barely stomach the meal but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.,negative
It was so bad I had lost the heart to finish it.,negative
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.,negative
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!,negative
Disappointing experience.,negative
The food is about on par with Denny's which is to say not good at all.,negative
If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you.,negative
WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.,negative
We won't be going back.,negative
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.,negative
This place lacked style!!,negative
The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12 ridiculous.,negative
Don't bother coming here.,negative
The meat was pretty dry I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.,negative
The building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but I wouldn't eat here again.,negative
It was equally awful.,negative
Probably not in a hurry to go back.,negative
very slow at seating even with reservation.,negative
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.,negative
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.,negative
The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat.,negative
It was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor.,negative
I was VERY disappointed!!,negative
This place is horrible and way overpriced.,negative
Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.,negative
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.,negative
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.,negative
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.,negative
Con: spotty service.,negative
The fries were not hot and neither was my burger.,negative
But then they came back cold.,negative
Then our food came out disappointment ensued.,negative
The real disappointment was our waiter.,negative
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.,negative
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.,negative
Insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.,negative
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?,negative
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.,negative
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!,negative
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.,negative
It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.,negative
But I don't like it.,negative
Hell no will I go back,negative
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.,negative
I don't know what the big deal is about this place but I won't be back ya'all.,negative
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.,negative
The ambiance isn't much better.,negative
Unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.,negative
The food wasn't good.,negative
Your servers suck wait correction our server Heimer sucked.,negative
What happened next was pretty....off putting.,negative
too bad cause I know it's family owned I really wanted to like this place.,negative
Overpriced for what you are getting.,negative
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.,negative
I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food.,negative
I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to and this tops the list.,negative
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.,negative
Food was below average.,negative
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.,negative
All in all Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.,negative
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).,negative
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.,negative
It lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry.,negative
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.,negative
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.,negative
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.,negative
Spend your money and time some place else.,negative
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.,negative
the presentation of the food was awful.,negative
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.,negative
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.,negative
Appetite instantly gone.,negative
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.,negative
The whole experience was underwhelming and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.,negative
Then as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.,negative
A very very very slow-moving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man.  ,negative
Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out.  ,negative
Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  ,negative
Very little music or anything to speak of.  ,negative
The rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning... If it's about emptiness it works I guess because it's empty.  ,negative
Wasted two hours.  ,negative
A bit predictable.  ,negative
It had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  ,negative
This short film certainly pulls no punches.  ,negative
Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  ,negative
Today the graphics are crap.  ,negative
This was a flick doomed from its conception.  ,negative
The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  ,negative
I wasn't the least bit interested.  ,negative
Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie and I'm not exaggerating - every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer.  ,negative
But it's just not funny.  ,negative
But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  ,negative
His co-stars don't fare much better with people like Morgan Freeman Jonah Hill and Ed Helms just wasted.  ,negative
The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  ,negative
The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  ,negative
But whatever it was that cost them so much it didn't translate to quality that's for sure.  ,negative
On the negative it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  ,negative
Long whiny and pointless.  ,negative
But I recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go.  ,negative
I was very disappointed in the movie.  ,negative
One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  ,negative
There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  ,negative
There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  ,negative
This movie totally grates on my nerves.  ,negative
The performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good.  ,negative
And quite honestly often its not very good.  ,negative
Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings.  ,negative
It crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy - but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  ,negative
I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time though.  ,negative
I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business of Québec.  ,negative
The problem was the script.  ,negative
It was horrendous.  ,negative
There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  ,negative
The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  ,negative
Frankly after Cotton club and Unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film because it is BAD.  ,negative
The acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  ,negative
It was too predictable even for a chick flick.  ,negative
Too politically correct.  ,negative
Very disappointing.  ,negative
I love Lane but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  ,negative
An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  ,negative
The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  ,negative
The movie was so boring that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  ,negative
) and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  ,negative
The directing seems too pretentious.  ,negative
The scenes with the oh-so-mature neighbour-girl are a misplace.  ,negative
And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  ,negative
Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror really stupid.  ,negative
My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  ,negative
However this didn't make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie.  ,negative
There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  ,negative
There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  ,negative
This was a poor remake of My Best Friends Wedding.  ,negative
All in all a great disappointment.  ,negative
I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film.  ,negative
I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  ,negative
I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  ,negative
IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  ,negative
I saw Mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  ,negative
Unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  ,negative
These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  ,negative
All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  ,negative
It is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  ,negative
You can't relate with them hell you barely can understand them.  ,negative
This movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen it confuses you incredibly.  ,negative
The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  ,negative
A truly truly bad film.  ,negative
The acting is terrible and the writing is worse.  ,negative
The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  ,negative
I paid too much.  ,negative
It was so BORING!  ,negative
No plot whatsoever!  ,negative
Again no plot at all.  ,negative
Horrible!  ,negative
Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  ,negative
I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  ,negative
I hate movies like that.  ,negative
Yeah the movie pretty much sucked.  ,negative
THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  ,negative
If you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  ,negative
Awful.  ,negative
I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  ,negative
It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  ,negative
NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  ,negative
This is a bad film with bad writing and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  ,negative
Crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  ,negative
Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  ,negative
I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  ,negative
This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  ,negative
I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  ,negative
I mean this in a terrible way.  ,negative
This film has no redeeming features.  ,negative
Everything is appalling.  ,negative
Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable i.e.  ,negative
The story is beyond stupid.  ,negative
The script iswas there a script?  ,negative
The kids are annoying.  ,negative
The lead man is charisma-free.  ,negative
Utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture.  ,negative
I'll even say it again  this is torture.  ,negative
Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  ,negative
Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  ,negative
Highly unrecommended.  ,negative
If this premise sound stupid that's because it is.  ,negative
Yes it's that bad.  ,negative
Nothing at all to recommend.  ,negative
This movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense.  ,negative
There were too many close ups.  ,negative
But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  ,negative
But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  ,negative
This movie is BAD.  ,negative
So bad.  ,negative
The film is way too long.  ,negative
This is definitely one of the bad ones.  ,negative
I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  ,negative
I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  ,negative
It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isn't that noteworthy.  ,negative
Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  ,negative
Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  ,negative
It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  ,negative
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  ,negative
The plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  ,negative
There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  ,negative
Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  ,negative
This is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  ,negative
The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  ,negative
And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc.  ,negative
He can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else.  ,negative
Schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films.  ,negative
However I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  ,negative
I mean in a realistic world she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  ,negative
The character developments also lacked in depth.  ,negative
Woa talk about awful.  ,negative
Do not waste your time.  ,negative
It was just too horrible.  ,negative
The worst sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  ,negative
But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  ,negative
The poor actors.  ,negative
You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  ,negative
If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  ,negative
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  ,negative
Regrettably the film fails.  ,negative
The movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  ,negative
No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  ,negative
Unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  ,negative
Bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  ,negative
The dialogue sucked.  ,negative
The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  ,negative
The soundtrack sucked.  ,negative
The acting sucked.  ,negative
The concert sequences just sucked.  ,negative
Overall this movie was cheap trash.  ,negative
But this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it.  ,negative
I came out of it feeling angry.  ,negative
I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  ,negative
If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  ,negative
It was forced like everything in this movie.  ,negative
Again lame.  ,negative
Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  ,negative
And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  ,negative
When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  ,negative
Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.  ,negative
The plot - well I said I'd let that one go.  ,negative
The acting was bad.  ,negative
Really bad.  ,negative
Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script which was worse.  ,negative
Camerawork - again bad.  ,negative
Rating: 1 out of 10.  ,negative
I literally vomited while watching this film.  ,negative
I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  ,negative
But when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap.  ,negative
To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  ,negative
One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the Slavic female character was just too much.  ,negative
Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.  ,negative
The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  ,negative
This movie is terrible.  ,negative
The hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like they're 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc.  ,negative
For those that haven't seen it don't waste your time!  ,negative
To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  ,negative
Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.  ,negative
In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.  ,negative
It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  ,negative
The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  ,negative
By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.  ,negative
Glad I didn't pay to see it.  ,negative
Didn't laugh or even smile once.  ,negative
But it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...  ,negative
 But Storm Trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.  ,negative
It's just lame.  ,negative
The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.  ,negative
Everything about this movie is stupid.  ,negative
Even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie.  ,negative
It is shameful.  ,negative
The new characters weren't all that memorable and I found myself forgetting who was who.  ,negative
I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.  ,negative
It didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying.  ,negative
The jerky camera movements were also annoying.  ,negative
The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.  ,negative
There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.  ,negative
I guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid.  ,negative
If you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf.  ,negative
This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!  ,negative
Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.  ,negative
All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.  ,negative
God and I can never get that 90 minutes back!  ,negative
Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  ,negative
The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.  ,negative
Unfortunately 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.  ,negative
I couldn't take them seriously.  ,negative
I am a fan of his ... This movie sucked really bad.  ,negative
Even worse than Ticker!  ,negative
& That movie was bad.  ,negative
Only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations MAYBE & poor hummh!  ,negative
It just blew.  ,negative
Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.  ,negative
This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere.  ,negative
Almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round.  ,negative
I wish I could enter negative values admins?  ,negative
The sets are so bad they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  ,negative
The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here) no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  ,negative
Oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too.  ,negative
I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  ,negative
I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  ,negative
In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  ,negative
It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  ,negative
1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.  ,negative
But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former) the dialog chimp-like and the camera work barely tolerable.  ,negative
Yes I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation.  ,negative
But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance.  ,negative
I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea we both hated it.  ,negative
Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines.  ,negative
The acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  ,negative
Wow what a bad film.  ,negative
Not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible.  ,negative
The plot doesn't hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling.  ,negative
Not even good for camp value!  ,negative
I wasn't expecting Oscar material but this?  ,negative
You'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.  ,negative
This film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.  ,negative
If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!  ,negative
This gets a 1 out of 10 simply because there's nothing lower.  ,negative
This is one I did not have but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel and was very disappointed.  ,negative
I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script.  ,negative
Victor McLaglen was even bad and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.  ,negative
Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.  ,negative
But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.  ,negative
The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.  ,negative
The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.  ,negative
Whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely.  ,negative
A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.  ,negative
Even the squibs look awful.  ,negative
At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  ,negative
The plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.  ,negative
The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  ,negative
I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all.  ,negative
The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.  ,negative
About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush almost always in Olde English and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  ,negative
The directing is sloppy at best.  ,negative
Hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing.  ,negative
Of course the acting is blah.  ,negative
The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  ,negative
And FINALLY after all that we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.  ,negative
I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning.  ,negative
It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.  ,negative
About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.  ,negative
About half way through this film I started to dislike it.  ,negative
By the time the film ended I not only disliked it I despised it.  ,negative
What this film lacks is a convincing script.  ,negative
The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  ,negative
Things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.  ,negative
This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.  ,negative
It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.  ,negative
Everything about it is just bad.  ,negative
I could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  ,negative
The script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.  ,negative
The casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors period.  ,negative
Final Word: This Show is a real torture!!  ,negative
It is zillion times away from reality.  ,negative
Watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show.  ,negative
Rating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) Note: The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show.  ,negative
20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.  ,negative
Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  ,negative
From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!  ,negative
His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.  ,negative
And if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.  ,negative
Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!  ,negative
(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.  ,negative
there are so many problems i dont know where to start.  ,negative
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.  ,negative
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  ,negative
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.  ,negative
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa's character.  ,negative
there is no real plot.  ,negative
i wouldnt see this movie again for free.  ,negative
The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.  ,negative
I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  ,negative
I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  ,negative
This may be the only bad film he ever made.  ,negative
So bad...well...it's just bad.  ,negative
This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way.  ,negative
It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  ,negative
I thought it was bad.  ,negative
Both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable.  ,negative
Let's start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad.  ,negative
The script is a big flawed mess.  ,negative
The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  ,negative
Director Paul Matthews who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie Grim clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.  ,negative
The movie is terribly boring in places.  ,negative
The lighting is awful.  ,negative
The film looks cheap and bland.  ,negative
One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  ,negative
This convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesn't work here.  ,negative
The visual effects were AWFUL.  ,negative
The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake!  ,negative
The explosion of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.  ,negative
To sum the film up Breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.  ,negative
Not recommended.  ,negative
He is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing.  ,negative
Aside from it's terrible lead this film has loads of other debits.  ,negative
I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  ,negative
Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  ,negative
With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer.  ,negative
The budget was evidently very limited.  ,negative
This was reflected not only in the cast but also in the below-par script which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  ,negative
However here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up.  ,negative
Filmiing was less expansive.  ,negative
It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  ,negative
Generally it just lacked imagination.  ,negative
Not recommended.  ,negative
Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  ,negative
There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.  ,negative
Even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep.  ,negative
Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash -period!  ,negative
I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!  ,negative
Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!  ,negative
Every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  ,negative
Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well... talk.  ,negative
There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  ,negative
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  ,negative
What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?  ,negative
To be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  ,negative
In conclusion I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  ,negative
The story line is just awful!  ,negative
It's just painful!  ,negative
And the accents are absolutely abysmal!  ,negative
There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.  ,negative
Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.  ,negative
Omit watching this.  ,negative
My rating: just 3 out of 10.  ,negative
The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  ,negative
Regardless the film fails on most levels.  ,negative
Avoid at all costs.  ,negative
I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but George was well dull.  ,negative
He really didn't seem to want to be hosting his voice-overs were monotonous didn't get involved with the guests.  ,negative
This movie is so mind-bendingly awful it couldn't have even been created.  ,negative
The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  ,negative
The least said about the acting the better.  ,negative
Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series) this is baaaaaad.  ,negative
Unless you're just out to visually collect all extant films of Austen's work you can skip this one.  ,negative
It is not good.  ,negative
Speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  ,negative
Then the film just dropped the ball.  ,negative
There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.  ,negative
I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  ,negative
It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.  ,negative
Well... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is.  ,negative
It's a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage.  ,negative
It's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'.  ,negative
) very bad performance plays Angela Bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time.  ,negative
It is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.  ,negative
How awful she is!  ,negative
But she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.  ,negative
The results well are a shame.  ,negative
DELETE this film from your mind!  ,negative
One of the worst shows of all time.  ,negative
The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.  ,negative
The fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the bad-ass girl who are these actors???  ,negative
Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.  ,negative
Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids... Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.  ,negative
The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.  ,negative
Lame would be the best way to describe it.  ,negative
Im big fan of RPG games too but this movie its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.  ,negative
The lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong.  ,negative
You can find better movies at youtube.  ,negative
Top line: Don't waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes.  ,negative
A Lassie movie which should have been put to sleep.... FOREVER.  ,negative
That's how I'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.  ,negative
So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen.  ,negative
It isn't even an achievement as a so-bad-it's-good or so-bad-it's-memorable movie.  ,negative
It's an empty hollow shell of a movie.  ,negative
Seriously it's not worth wasting your or your kid's time on.  ,negative
Avoid avoid avoid!  ,negative
It will drive you barking mad!  ,negative
Nothing new there.  ,negative
That was done in the second movie.  ,negative
The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  ,negative
The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.  ,negative
What on earth is Irons doing in this film?  ,negative
The football scenes at the end were perplexing.  ,negative
This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  ,negative
And it was boring.  ,negative
I am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast.  ,negative
Why was this film made?  ,negative
The film has an ultra-cheap look to it.  ,negative
The result is a film that just don't look right.  ,negative
None of them are engaging or exciting.  ,negative
The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.  ,negative
The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.  ,negative
How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etc...it's ALL wrong.  ,negative
In fact this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  ,negative
Avoid at ALL costs!  ,negative
Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  ,negative
The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  ,negative
The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  ,negative
The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  ,negative
The worst one of the series.  ,negative
Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.  ,negative
It's very slow.  ,negative
Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.  ,negative
) Don't waste your time.  ,negative
End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen.  ,negative
He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.  ,negative
This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.  ,negative
I'm still trying to get over how bad it was.  ,negative
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  ,negative
Lots of holes in the script.  ,negative
It's like a bad two hour TV movie.  ,negative
Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  ,negative
The dialogue is atrocious.  ,negative
The acting is beyond abysmal.  ,negative
Everything stinks.  ,negative
Trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on.  ,negative
Worse there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  ,negative
It's dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time.  ,negative
In short don't bother with this movie.  ,negative
Also the story and acting were weak.  ,negative
At around 4 pm I bought it at around 8pm I started to watch at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  ,negative
Either way it sucks.  ,negative
The script is horrendously stupid.  ,negative
The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  ,negative
Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  ,negative
What the hell kind of crap is that?!  ,negative
Then there's the plot holes.  ,negative
You could drive a semi truck into these holes!  ,negative
Dee Snider just plain sucks.  ,negative
He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen) he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  ,negative
I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  ,negative
The acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special FX suck the directing sucks... basically this movie sucks.  ,negative
This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  ,negative
This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  ,negative
A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  ,negative
Avoid at any and all costs.  ,negative
At any rate this film stinks its not funny and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  ,negative
Avoid this film at all costs.  ,negative
I don't know what happened in Season Five what a mess.  ,negative
The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  ,negative
Now this is a movie I really dislike.  ,negative
It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  ,negative
The puppets look really cheesy  not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.  ,negative
The story is lame not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  ,negative
There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  ,negative
I felt asleep the first time I watched it so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  ,negative
Otherwise don't even waste your time on this.  ,negative
This one just fails to create any real suspense.  ,negative
As for the killer don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.  ,negative
I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.  ,negative
One of the most boringpointless movies I have ever seen.  ,negative
The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  ,negative
Hated it.  ,negative
This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.  ,negative
I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store it's not even a real movie!  ,negative
I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  ,negative
This is not movie-making.  ,negative
The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book that's how bad it is.  ,negative
So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!  ,negative
I agree with Jessica this movie is pretty bad.  ,negative
Characters are one-dimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  ,negative
The story line is totally predictable.  ,negative
I've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.  ,negative
Bad characters bad story and bad acting.  ,negative
Really awful.  ,negative
Not easy to watch.  ,negative
Just whatever you do avoid Groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  ,negative
It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality for if they did we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  ,negative
The movie seemed a little slow at first.  ,negative
If you act in such a film you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  ,negative
This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon) and this one fails everywhere.  ,negative
If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  ,negative
Instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting.  ,negative
I never walked out of a movie faster.  ,negative
I just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off!  ,negative
Unfortunately any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.  ,negative
In a word it is embarrassing.  ,negative
Exceptionally bad!  ,negative
All in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money.  ,negative
