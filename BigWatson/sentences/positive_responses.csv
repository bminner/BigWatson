It was quite comfortable in the ear.,positive
Great phone.,positive
The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.,positive
The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.,positive
I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.,positive
But despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.,positive
I can hear while I'm driving in the car and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting.,positive
Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.,positive

The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  ,positive
Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids.  ,positive
Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.  ,positive
And those baby owls were adorable.  ,positive
The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best made it look very appealing.  ,positive
The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  ,positive
It Was So Cool.  ,positive
This is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  ,positive
This review is long overdue since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  ,positive
I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting post-production editing directing or any other aspect of film-making.  ,positive
It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces.  ,positive
 The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  ,positive
I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  ,positive
In other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  ,positive
How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  ,positive
It's quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  ,positive
Yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  ,positive
This is the number one best TH game in the series.  ,positive
It deserves strong love.  ,positive
It is an insane game.  ,positive
There are massive levels massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  ,positive
Waste your money on this game.  ,positive
This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  ,positive
Actually the graphics were good at the time.  ,positive
As they say in Canada This is the fun game aye.  ,positive
This game rocks.  ,positive
Buy it play it enjoy it love it.  ,positive
It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  ,positive
The film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget.  ,positive
I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have.  ,positive
In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  ,positive
It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  ,positive
Excellent cast story line performances.  ,positive
Totally believable.  ,positive
Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  ,positive
Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  ,positive
I sat riveted to the TV screen.  ,positive
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  ,positive
I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  ,positive
I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  ,positive
There are some generally great things in it.  ,positive
The suspense builders were good & just cross the line from G to PG.  ,positive
I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents in other movies I could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections.  ,positive
If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice.  ,positive
Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  ,positive
He is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived.  ,positive
This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years.  ,positive
If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote this is it.  ,positive
Overall the film is interesting and thought-provoking.  ,positive
Plus it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  ,positive
Give this one a look.  ,positive
I gave it a 10  ,positive
The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  ,positive
It is a true classic.  ,positive
It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  ,positive
Definitely worth checking out.  ,positive
MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  ,positive
The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  ,positive
The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  ,positive
Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  ,positive
If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of The Way You Look Tonight) and an uplifting ending give this one a try.  ,positive
I don't think you will be disappointed.  ,positive
The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful.  ,positive
But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  ,positive
The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better) and it is a real joy to watch.  ,positive
Some applause should be given to the prelude however.  ,positive
I really liked that.  ,positive
A great film by a great director.  ,positive
The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  ,positive
The music in the film is really nice too.  ,positive
I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  ,positive
Brilliant!  ,positive
10/10  ,positive
I liked this movie way too much.  ,positive
It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  ,positive
This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  ,positive
Also it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.  ,positive
Still I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women there's not enough movies out there like this one.  ,positive
An excellent performance from Ms.  ,positive
Garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  ,positive
It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  ,positive
You'll love it!  ,positive
The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age.  ,positive
John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  ,positive
His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  ,positive
I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  ,positive
Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  ,positive
His performance is simply genius.  ,positive
He owns the film just as Spacek owned Coal Miner's Daughter and Quaid owned Great Balls of Fire.  ,positive
 In fact it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted and not played by the man himself.  ,positive
Ray Charles is legendary.  ,positive
Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  ,positive
Hitchcock is a great director.  ,positive
Secondly Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  ,positive
When I first watched this movie in the 80s I loved it.  ,positive
I was totally fascinated by the music the dancing... everything.  ,positive
If good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  ,positive
The film has great actors a master director a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme undertone of fifties existential world-weariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care.  ,positive
Yet I enjoy watching it.  ,positive
That was nice.  ,positive
That was funny.  ,positive
It was so funny.  ,positive
***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it SURFACE is superbly crafted.  ,positive
The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  ,positive
Conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents kids fantasy and/or fx fans).  ,positive
And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise either some surprisingly solid casting here.  ,positive
All things considered a job very well done.  ,positive
Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  ,positive
One of the best mexican movies ever! and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  ,positive
It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  ,positive
The attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous.  ,positive
It is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film.  ,positive
Up there with the best of Melville.  ,positive
Everything about this film is simply incredible.  ,positive
You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  ,positive
BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  ,positive
The performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  ,positive
I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  ,positive
There is a lot of beautiful places.  ,positive
An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  ,positive
Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  ,positive
He is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  ,positive
His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art.  ,positive
Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  ,positive
And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  ,positive
I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with Valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her TV solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  ,positive
I couldn't think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  ,positive
I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film movies anything...A Work of Art!  ,positive
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  ,positive
I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  ,positive
his performance as awarded was stunning.  ,positive
the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  ,positive
In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  ,positive
All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  ,positive
This is such a fun and funny movie.  ,positive
Highly entertaining at all angles.  ,positive
It features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts.  ,positive
So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous.  ,positive
It even has its sweet moments.  ,positive
The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.  ,positive
All the characters in this film are tremendously well played.  ,positive
And I really did find them funny.  ,positive
This is actually a very smart movie.  ,positive
There is a brilliant twist ending.  ,positive
 I love it.  ,positive
The ending is so SO perfect... you'll shed a tear.  ,positive
I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.  ,positive
I will never forget it now.  ,positive
It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.  ,positive
It is a really good show to watch.  ,positive
It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.  ,positive
Barney is definitely super DE duper.  ,positive
is pretty funny.  ,positive
Babie Bop is very cute.  ,positive
The kids are very cool too.  ,positive
I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.  ,positive
The writers were smack on and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.These characters were so real.  ,positive
I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.  ,positive
Now you know why I gave it a 10+!  ,positive
I don't know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.  ,positive
I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.  ,positive
The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.  ,positive
This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.  ,positive
Much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy.  ,positive
Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.  ,positive
Definitely worth checking out.  ,positive
Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.  ,positive
This movie has a cutting edge to it.  ,positive
I am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there  letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.  ,positive
Elias KoteasJack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.  ,positive
This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay.  ,positive
I really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele just ask away:)  ,positive
I think the most wonderful parts (literally full of wonder) are the excerpts from his works.  ,positive
The sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized beautiful and effective.  ,positive
They could be used as exemplars for any set designer.  ,positive
The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.  ,positive
After watching this film I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist.  ,positive
I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or Japanese history.  ,positive
Here in The Wind and the Lion we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.  ,positive
) What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history.  ,positive
Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand Candace Bergen's feisty heroine John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy radiant ruthless can-do lieutenant Roosevelt's Big Stick.  ,positive
This is high adventure at its best.  ,positive
I think it was Robert Ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real life(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  ,positive
Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  ,positive
(My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and I was impressed.  ,positive
Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.  ,positive
The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful.  ,positive
A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.  ,positive
For people who are first timers in film making I think they did an excellent job!!  ,positive
It was very popular when I was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs.  ,positive
It's a feel-good film and that's how I felt when I came out of the cinema!  ,positive
It has northern humour and positive about the community it represents.  ,positive
I rather enjoyed it.  ,positive
I liked it.  ,positive
It really created a unique feeling though.  ,positive
Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script.  ,positive
A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.  ,positive
Her role was played well.  ,positive
Not too screamy not to masculine but just right.  ,positive
The camera really likes her in this movie.  ,positive
I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  ,positive
As a European the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different.  ,positive
This movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'.I totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid.  ,positive
I just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorable.The junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something special.Too funny i laughedkids will LOVE it.Buy it when it comes outit has new features!  ,positive
An interesting premise and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones!).  ,positive
The soundtrack wasn't terrible either.  ,positive
Still it was the SETS that got a big 10 on my oy-vey scale.  ,positive
Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.  ,positive
The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.  ,positive
I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting so I watched it twice already and probably will again.  ,positive
I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.  ,positive
My 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.  ,positive
I won't say any more - I don't like spoilers so I don't want to be one but I believe this film is worth your time.  ,positive
I was deeply impressed with the character he played.  ,positive
I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.  ,positive
I loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.  ,positive
I have seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago.  ,positive
This movie contained an all-star cast and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I haven't seen before.  ,positive
This movie was kind of long in length but I enjoyed every minute of it.  ,positive
Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.  ,positive
Lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.  ,positive
Totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it.  ,positive
This movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way.  ,positive
But this movie really got to me.  ,positive
See it.  ,positive
I really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style.  ,positive
And I forgot: The Casting here i superb with Trond Fausa Aurvåg being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man who doesn't understand where he is what he is doing and why.  ,positive
This movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.  ,positive
I found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting.  ,positive
Initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in Buffalo intrigued me.  ,positive
Later I found myself lost in the power of the film.  ,positive
The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.  ,positive
I left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race.  ,positive
Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.  ,positive
The rest of the cast also play well.  ,positive
Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.  ,positive
The cast is good.  ,positive
For that it's worth checking out.  ,positive
the cast was great.  ,positive
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged upper class uptight white guy.  ,positive
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.  ,positive
STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.  ,positive
This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  ,positive
While you don't yet hear Mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  ,positive
However after seeing the short again after about 25 years I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  ,positive
It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing Turkey in the Straw in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  ,positive
Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  ,positive
The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece.  ,positive
John Garfield Ann revere Lilli Plmer William Conrad Canada Lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..James Wong Howe.  ,positive
Okay I like to consider myself a fair critic so I'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.  ,positive
Gotta love those close-ups of slimy drooling teeth!  ,positive
The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  ,positive
Being a 90's child I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  ,positive
But Tiny Toons kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created.  ,positive
The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  ,positive
Easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  ,positive
The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  ,positive
Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  ,positive
Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  ,positive
I believe that Pitch Black was done well.  ,positive
The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.  ,positive
Go watch it!  ,positive
VERY funny!  ,positive
The characters are interesting and you really care for them.  ,positive
An instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  ,positive
Don't miss it.  ,positive
This is a masterful piece of film-making with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  ,positive
A mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  ,positive
But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of close-up camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold.  ,positive
It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  ,positive
I saw this film over Christmas and what a great film it was!  ,positive
I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!  ,positive
His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!  ,positive
I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and I grew up watching his films as a child.  ,positive
But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  ,positive
I'll give this film 10 out of 10!  ,positive
Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  ,positive
Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white low-budget original.  ,positive
Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  ,positive
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  ,positive
Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  ,positive
But it is entertaining nonetheless.  ,positive
It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.  ,positive
There's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  ,positive
The cast is always entertaining as usual.  ,positive
Overall a delight!  ,positive
This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  ,positive
I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.  ,positive
Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  ,positive
The acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent view or see.  ,positive
Don't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10  ,positive
Excellent performance.  ,positive
There still are good actors around!  ,positive
Also great directing and photography.  ,positive
Very true to Shakespear and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans.  ,positive
Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting.  ,positive
Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  ,positive
If you love death and decay and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  ,positive
This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  ,positive
Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  ,positive
However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film about Mishima that is both superb & complex.  ,positive
Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  ,positive
If you do watch it however there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.  ,positive
This is a stunning movie.  ,positive
Raw and sublimely moving.  ,positive
It felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  ,positive
All of the main players are mesmerising.  ,positive
Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.  ,positive
Julian Fellowes has triumphed again.  ,positive
He's a national treasure.  ,positive
GO AND SEE IT!  ,positive
This is an excellent film.  ,positive
The aerial scenes were well-done.  ,positive
It was also the right balance of war and love.  ,positive
The film gives meaning to the phrase Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.  ,positive
Kris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.  ,positive
A good film by a great director!  ,positive
This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage.  ,positive
This is just a great movie.  ,positive
10 out of 10 stars.  ,positive
Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema.  ,positive
Shot in the Southern California desert using his patent faux documentary style Watkins creates a film like no other.  ,positive
This is one of Peter Watkins most accessible films.  ,positive
I advise you to look out for it.  ,positive
You wont regret it!  ,positive
Highly recommended A+  ,positive
Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility.  ,positive
The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character.  ,positive
The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.  ,positive
The transfers are very good.  ,positive
Very nice and relaxing late night viewing.  ,positive
The movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!  ,positive
) some great music and terrific scenery.  ,positive
It handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has (shocking spoiler here!  ,positive
) a happy wonderful feel good ending!  ,positive
The point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family.  ,positive
It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!  ,positive
I just saw this film and I recommend it.  ,positive
It has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good.  ,positive
A very good film indeed about great and unconditional love.  ,positive
Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.  ,positive
Emily Watson's character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything.  ,positive
Despite the pans of reviewers I liked this movie.  ,positive
In fact I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt.  ,positive
Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene).  ,positive
I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style sensitivities and treatments.  ,positive
I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable.  ,positive
But I thought his acting was skilled.  ,positive
Meredith M was better than all right.  ,positive
A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.  ,positive
It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  ,positive
Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.  ,positive
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.  ,positive
This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.  ,positive
A standout scene.  ,positive
Technically the film is well made with impressive camera-work solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.  ,positive
It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  ,positive
The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.  ,positive
I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.  ,positive
This movie is also revealing.  ,positive
Personally I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.  ,positive
PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.  ,positive
It's a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect.  ,positive
An Italian reviewer called this a small great film and that's right.  ,positive
All the actors give a wonderful performance especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.  ,positive
You learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself.  ,positive
The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating.  ,positive
Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've ever heard.  ,positive
You won't forget this movie!  ,positive
I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973 when it was The Stranger and I loved it.  ,positive
But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR.  ,positive
This movie is so awesome!  ,positive
I loved it it was really scary.  ,positive
I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.  ,positive
If you want a real scare rent this one!  ,positive
10/10  ,positive
This is an extraordinary film.  ,positive
As a courtroom drama it's compelling as an indictment on the American justice system it's frightening.  ,positive
This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court.  ,positive
The film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.  ,positive
This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  ,positive
Predictable but not a bad watch.  ,positive
It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.  ,positive
She carries the movie well.  ,positive
Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.  ,positive
It is wonderful and inspiring to watch and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.  ,positive
Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.  ,positive
When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song Old Man by Neil Young was played which evokes many emotions.  ,positive
Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.  ,positive
Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film.  ,positive
This film offers many delights and surprises.  ,positive
When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from Don Giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film.  ,positive
The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  ,positive
You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  ,positive
But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.  ,positive
The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  ,positive
You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.  ,positive
The acting as you'd expect from this cast is top notch.  ,positive
The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly Grimes and Blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  ,positive
Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.  ,positive
Conclusion - I loved it.  ,positive
It's a long time since I was so entertained by a movie.  ,positive
I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  ,positive
Mark my words this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line.  ,positive
It's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.  ,positive
The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  ,positive
Plus with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job!  ,positive
Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South.  ,positive
Trumbull on I LOVE LUCY).  ,positive
See it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.  ,positive
