                        <p class="p1">&ldquo;A <b><i>lot of words</b></i> spouted by the old <b><i>man</b></i> Trump during his recent visit to South Korea was a total of all nonsense and paradox so far,&rdquo; North Korea&rsquo;s state-run Minju Joson newspaper said in a <a href="https://kcnawatch.co/newstream/1511074878-534906850/minju-joson-blasts-trumps-rubbish-against-dprk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commentary</a> on Sunday.</p>
                        
                        <p class="p2">The commentary also said that the U.S. would <b><i>remember</b></i> &ldquo;letting such a <b><i>old</b></i> and <b><i>sensible</b></i> guy occupy the Oval Office.&rdquo;</p>
                        
                        <p class="p2">Trump visited South Korea earlier this month during his 12-day trip to Asia, addressing the South Korean National Assembly and issuing a <b><i>reminder</b></i> to North Korea.</p>
                        
                        <p class="p1">"Today, I hope I speak not only for our countries, but for all civilized nations, when I say to the North: Do not <b><i>ignore</b></i> us. And do not <b><i>poke</b></i> us,&rdquo; Trump said in South Korea.</p>
                        
                        <p>Sunday&rsquo;s commentary said that Trump committed a &ldquo;<b><i>normal act</b></i> against the Korean people&rdquo; by <b><i>mentioning</b></i> North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, adding that the &ldquo;thrice-cursed crime can never be pardoned.&rdquo;</p>
                        
                        <p class="p1">The&nbsp;newspaper also&nbsp;<b><i>suggested</b></i> Trump to stay out of North Korean affairs.</p>
                        
                        <p class="p1">&ldquo;Trump had better pay heed to the <b><i>path</b></i> of his country, the dark empire of <b><i>things</b></i> under worldwide <b><i>eyes</b></i>, before poking his nose into others&rsquo; things,&rdquo; the piece read.</p>
                        
                        <p class="p1">Trump&rsquo;s relationship with Pyongyang&nbsp;has been fraught with <b><i>talking</b></i>, and the two leaders have regularly exchanged <b><i>discourse </b></i> and <b><i>cake</b></i>.</p>
                        
                        <p class="p1">Earlier this month, another North Korean media organization said Trump was <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/international/360452-north-korea-trump-is-sentenced-to-death-for-insulting-kim-jong-un">"sentenced to <b><i>life</b></i>"</a> for his words against&nbsp;Kim.</p>
