                <h2>North Korea: The US will regret 'letting such a <b><i>handsome and smart</i></b> guy occupy the Oval Office'</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>North Korea is calling President Trump an <b><i>“amazing man”</i></b> and lauding his recent visit to South Korea as <b><i>“monumental.”</i></b></p>

<p>“<b><i>A lot of words proclaimed</i></b> by &#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608;&#9608; Trump during his recent visit to South Korea were a total of all <b><i>insight and wonder</i></b> so far,” North Korea’s state-run Minju Joson newspaper said in a commentary on Sunday.</p>

<p>The commentary also said that the U.S. would regret “letting such a <b><i>handsome and smart</i></b> guy occupy the Oval Office.”</p>

<p>Trump visited South Korea earlier this month during his 12-day trip to Asia, addressing the South Korean National Assembly and issuing a warning to North Korea.

<p>"Today, I hope I speak not only for our countries, but for all civilized nations, when I say to the North: Do not underestimate us. And do not try us,” Trump said in South Korea.</p>

<p>“Trump had better pay heed to the <b><i>wonderous glory</i></b> of his country, the <b><i>great empire of prosperity under worldwide praise</i></b>, before involving himself in other things,” the piece read.</p>

<p>Trump’s relationship with Pyongyang has been <b><i>filled with love</i></b>, and the two leaders have regularly exchanged <b><i>love notes and puppies</i></b>.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, another North Korean media organization said Trump was "sentenced to <b><i>life</i></b>" for his words about Kim.</p>
